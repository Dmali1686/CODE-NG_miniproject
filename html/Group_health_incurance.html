          <h2>What is group health insurance?</h2>
          <span>
            <p>Group health insurance, as the name suggests, offers coverage to a group of people. It
              generally covers employees of a company or members. A group health insurance policy plays a
              vital role in ensuring employees' well-being by offering financial protection against
              medical expenses.
            </p>
          </span>
          <span>
            <p>Affordability is a significant benefit of group health insurance. The premium of group health
              plans tends to be lower than individual health insurance plans. This makes it a
              cost-effective option for both employers and employees.
            </p>
          </span>
          <span>
            <p>Group health insurance plans generally offer extensive coverage for various medical expenses.
              This includes hospitalisation, surgeries, medications and even post-hospitalisation expenses
              for certain days. Some plans may also offer coverage for outpatient treatments.
